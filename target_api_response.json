Strawberry Flings taste like a 5th grade boy smashed Ritz crackers over a Fruit Rollup and packaged it for resale. If you close your eyes while chewing, you can actually taste the playground equipment from his unwashed hands. Mercifully, Flings are packaged just one to a foil pack, instead of the two that you would expect with a Pop Tart. This saves you money on flossers you'll need to pick bitter fruit snack gunk out of your teeth. I think landing on an accurate description of the taste of Flings is best done by calling them \"Dollar Store Fig Newtons.\" Nobody's enjoying this in their mouth.",

In other words, I've eaten a wide variety of natural, unnatural, keto, grain-free, high fiber, and low carb diet foods for many years. I'd never heard or read much good about these, but recently saw them in my recommendations and was surprised to see they now have a high 4+ rating, with some reviewers mentioning that the recipe was changed and greatly improved within the last year or two. I was growing a little tired of the mild aftertaste that the otherwise decent Legendary toaster pastries have, so I decided to finally give Flings a chance and bought the strawberry. I am the type of person that hates wasting money/food but this box is already in the trash. It's disappointing, but I have no desire to give these to someone else. They look nothing like what's on the box, taste like strong chemicals and a rancid Fig Newton, and have the texture of melting rubber. I'm shocked that these made it on store shelves, let alone have been around for years with growing praise. The product expiration is well before its \"Best By\" date, and the box does have the hype printing of \"New & Improved\" at the top. If this is improved, I'm glad I never tried the first released recipe. Looks like I'm taking a little break from toaster pastries, then returning to Legendary. Try them and decide for yourself if you must, but I'd personally trust the one-star reviews on this one.",
